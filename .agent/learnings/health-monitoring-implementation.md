# Health Monitoring Implementation

## Date: 2025-08-10

## Feature: Node Health Monitoring

### What We Built
Implemented a comprehensive health monitoring system for the Torua distributed cluster that:
- Performs periodic health checks on all registered nodes
- Detects node failures after configurable consecutive failures
- Marks nodes as unhealthy while keeping them visible in the cluster
- Triggers shard redistribution when nodes fail
- Integrates seamlessly with the coordinator

### Key Components

#### 1. HealthMonitor (`internal/coordinator/health_monitor.go`)
- Runs health checks on configurable interval (default 5s, test 2s)
- HTTP GET to `/health` endpoint on each node
- Tracks consecutive failures (3 failures = unhealthy)
- Thread-safe with RWMutex protection
- Graceful shutdown support
- Callback mechanism for unhealthy events

#### 2. Integration Points
- **NodeInfo struct**: Added `Status` and `LastHealthCheck` fields
- **Coordinator server**: Embedded HealthMonitor, starts on init
- **`/nodes` endpoint**: Returns health status for each node
- **Shard assignment**: Skips unhealthy nodes during redistribution

#### 3. Configuration
- `HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL` environment variable
- Format: Go duration string (e.g., "2s", "5s", "1m")
- Affects detection time: interval × max_failures = detection_time

### Implementation Challenges

#### 1. URL Format Handling
**Problem**: Nodes register with full URLs (`http://localhost:8081`) but health check was adding `http://` prefix again.
**Solution**: Check if address already has protocol prefix before adding.

#### 2. Node Removal vs Marking
**Problem**: Initially removed unhealthy nodes from list, but tests expected to see them marked unhealthy.
**Solution**: Keep nodes in list but mark with `status: "unhealthy"`.

#### 3. BDD Test Process Suspension
**Problem**: Goreman manages all processes, making individual process suspension difficult.
**Solution**: Use psutil to find processes by environment variables and suspend with SIGSTOP.

#### 4. Cleanup of Suspended Processes
**Problem**: Suspended processes held ports open, breaking subsequent tests.
**Solution**: Track suspended PIDs and kill them during test teardown.

### Test Coverage
- **Unit tests**: 8 comprehensive tests covering all scenarios
- **BDD tests**: "Node health monitoring" scenario now passing
- **Manual testing**: Verified with direct process suspension

### Key Learnings

1. **Process Management in Tests**
   - Goreman complicates individual process control
   - Need to track PIDs for cleanup
   - SIGSTOP leaves ports bound, requiring SIGKILL cleanup

2. **Health Check Design**
   - Simple HTTP GET is sufficient for basic health
   - Timeout (2s) prevents hanging on unresponsive nodes
   - Consecutive failure count prevents flapping

3. **State Management**
   - Keep unhealthy nodes visible for observability
   - Separate "unhealthy" from "removed" states
   - Health status should be queryable independently

4. **Configuration**
   - Make intervals configurable for testing vs production
   - Shorter intervals for tests (2s) vs production (5s+)
   - Balance between detection speed and network overhead

### Code Quality
- Comprehensive documentation for all functions
- Thread-safe implementation
- Graceful shutdown handling
- No goroutine leaks
- Clear separation of concerns

### Next Steps
1. Add metrics/Prometheus endpoint for health stats
2. Implement configurable failure thresholds
3. Add different health check types (TCP, custom endpoints)
4. Support for maintenance mode (intentional offline)
5. Historical health tracking for analysis

### Test Results
```
=== BDD Test: Node Health Monitoring ===
✓ Node marked unhealthy after 3 failures
✓ Status visible in /nodes endpoint
✓ Shard redistribution triggered
✓ Takes ~6-8 seconds with 2s interval

=== Unit Tests: HealthMonitor ===
✓ TestNewHealthMonitor
✓ TestHealthMonitorStart
✓ TestHealthMonitorNodeFailure
✓ TestHealthMonitorNodeRecovery
✓ TestHealthMonitorNodeRemoval
✓ TestHealthMonitorStop
✓ TestHealthMonitorConcurrency
✓ TestHealthMonitorGetNodeHealth
✓ TestHealthMonitorUnhealthyCallback
```

### Impact
- **17 BDD scenarios unblocked**: Health monitoring was prerequisite
- **Production readiness**: Critical for fault tolerance
- **Foundation for features**: Replication, auto-recovery need health data
- **Observability improved**: Can now see node health at a glance
