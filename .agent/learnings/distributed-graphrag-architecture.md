# Learning: Distributed GraphRAG Architecture

## Date: 2024-01-15
## Feature: Initial System Analysis and Documentation

## What I Learned

### 1. System Architecture Pattern
Torua implements a **simplified Elasticsearch-like architecture** for graph data:
- **Coordinator-Node pattern**: Central orchestrator with distributed workers
- **Self-organizing cluster**: Nodes auto-register on startup
- **Push-based registration**: Nodes announce themselves rather than being discovered
- **Broadcast communication**: One-to-many control message distribution

### 2. Code Organization Insights
The codebase follows Go best practices:
- **Clear separation**: `cmd/` for entry points, `internal/` for shared logic
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only `golang.org/x/exp` for slice utilities
- **Interface-driven**: HTTP-based communication allows language-agnostic nodes
- **Environment configuration**: All config via environment variables (12-factor app)

### 3. Distributed System Primitives
The foundation includes essential distributed system components:
- **Service Discovery**: Nodes register their ID and address
- **Health Monitoring**: Basic health endpoints at coordinator and nodes
- **Failure Handling**: Registration retry with exponential backoff
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Signal handling for clean termination

### 4. Design Decisions Worth Noting
Several architectural choices reveal the system's philosophy:
- **HTTP over RPC**: Simpler debugging, broader compatibility
- **In-memory state**: Coordinator keeps node list in memory (not persisted)
- **No consensus layer**: Single coordinator (not HA yet)
- **Sync registration**: Nodes block until successfully registered

### 5. GraphRAG Context
Understanding how this fits into GraphRAG:
- **Graph database**: Will use Kuzu embedded at each node
- **Sharding strategy**: Graph data distributed across nodes
- **Query distribution**: Coordinator will plan and route queries
- **RAG pipeline**: Graph traversals for context retrieval

### 6. Elasticsearch Parallels
How Torua mirrors Elasticsearch concepts:
- **Coordinator = Master Node**: Cluster state management
- **Nodes = Data Nodes**: Store and query data
- **Shards = Graph Partitions**: Horizontal data distribution
- **Broadcast = Cluster State Updates**: Control plane communication

### 7. Implementation Patterns
Clean Go patterns observed:
- **Context propagation**: Proper context usage for cancellation
- **Error handling**: Explicit error checking, fail-fast approach
- **Mutex usage**: RWMutex for concurrent read access
- **HTTP timeouts**: ReadHeaderTimeout prevents slow loris attacks

### 8. Operational Readiness
Current operational capabilities:
- **Process management**: Procfile for multi-process orchestration
- **Local development**: Make targets for easy local testing
- **Observability**: Logs show registration, messages, health
- **Testing tools**: curl examples for API verification

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start Simple**: The system begins with minimal viable clustering before adding complexity
2. **Distribution First**: Even basic operations assume multiple nodes
3. **Clear Boundaries**: Each component has a single, well-defined purpose
4. **Production Mindset**: Includes health checks, graceful shutdown from day one
5. **Developer Experience**: Easy local development with clear commands

## Architectural Insights

### Why This Architecture Works for GraphRAG

1. **Graph Locality**: Keeping related vertices/edges together minimizes network calls during traversals
2. **Horizontal Scaling**: Can add nodes to handle larger graphs or more queries
3. **Query Parallelism**: Distributed execution for complex graph algorithms
4. **Fault Isolation**: Node failures don't bring down the entire system

### Trade-offs Identified

**Chose Simplicity Over:**
- Complex consensus protocols (using single coordinator)
- Persistent cluster state (in-memory for now)
- Advanced routing (simple broadcast for now)

**Benefits:**
- Easier to understand and debug
- Faster initial development
- Clear upgrade path to more complex solutions

## Future Considerations

Based on the current architecture, the system is well-positioned for:

1. **Kuzu Integration**: Each node can embed Kuzu without architectural changes
2. **Query Planning**: Coordinator has the global view needed for optimization
3. **Replication**: Node registry can easily extend to track replicas
4. **Monitoring**: Health endpoints provide foundation for metrics

## Patterns to Replicate

When extending this system, follow these patterns:

1. **Environment-based config**: All configuration through environment variables
2. **HTTP APIs**: Continue using REST for simplicity
3. **Fail-fast with retry**: Quick failure detection with automatic retry
4. **Structured logging**: Include context in all log messages
5. **Graceful degradation**: Partial results better than no results

## Questions Answered

- **Q: Why HTTP instead of gRPC?**
  - A: Simplicity, debuggability, wider tool support

- **Q: Why no persistence for cluster state?**
  - A: Nodes re-register on coordinator restart, state rebuilds automatically

- **Q: How does this scale?**
  - A: Horizontally by adding nodes, sharding distributes load

- **Q: What about coordinator failure?**
  - A: Current design has single coordinator, HA is planned enhancement

## Implementation Notes

The codebase demonstrates several best practices:
- Timeouts on all network operations (5 seconds default)
- Proper context usage for cancellation
- Clean separation of concerns
- Minimal external dependencies
- Clear error messages

This learning will guide future development as we add Kuzu integration and distributed query capabilities.
