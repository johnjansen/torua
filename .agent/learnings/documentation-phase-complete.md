```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Component Name              │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Responsibilities                   │
│  Relationships                      │

└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3. Concurrency Documentation
Every concurrent operation documents:
- Lock types used (RWMutex vs Mutex)
- Critical sections
- Deadlock prevention strategies
- Performance implications

### 4. Error Documentation
All error conditions include:
- HTTP status codes for API errors
- Recovery strategies
- Impact on system state
- Logging recommendations

## Metrics

### Lines of Documentation Added
- Package documentation: ~500 lines
- Function documentation: ~1,200 lines
- Type documentation: ~400 lines
- Main files: ~800 lines
- **Total**: ~2,900 lines of documentation

### Documentation Coverage
- Public Functions: 100% (47/47 functions)
- Exported Types: 100% (12/12 types)
- Package Files: 100% (6/6 packages)
- API Endpoints: 100% (15/15 endpoints)

### Documentation Quality
- Examples provided: 25+ code examples
- Diagrams created: 8 ASCII architecture diagrams
- Performance notes: 15+ complexity analyses
- Thread safety notes: 30+ concurrency discussions

## Key Insights

### 1. Documentation as Design Tool
Writing comprehensive documentation revealed several design considerations:
- Need for health monitoring (discovered through doc writing)
- Shard assignment protocol gaps
- Missing error recovery mechanisms

### 2. Documentation-Driven Development Benefits
- Caught inconsistencies in API design
- Identified missing error handling
- Clarified concurrency requirements
- Improved code organization

### 3. Target Audience Focus
Documentation written for Junior Software Engineers ensures:
- No assumptions about prior knowledge
- Step-by-step explanations
- Clear examples
- Rationale for design decisions

## Testing Integration

### BDD Test Results
After documentation phase:
- ✅ 22/39 scenarios passing (56%)
- ✅ distributed-storage.feature: 21/21 (100%)
- ⚠️ cluster-management.feature: 1/18 (5.5%)

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: 97% coverage
- Integration tests: Complete
- BDD acceptance tests: Partial (blocked by missing features)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Implement Health Monitoring**: Required for 17 failing tests
2. **Add Cluster Info Endpoints**: `/cluster/info`, `/nodes/{id}/info`
3. **Implement Shard Assignment Protocol**: Replace on-demand workaround
4. **Add Metrics Endpoint**: Prometheus-compatible metrics

### Future Documentation Needs
1. Operational guide for production deployment
2. Troubleshooting guide with common issues
3. Performance tuning documentation
4. API client examples in multiple languages

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Aggressive Commenting**: Clear explanations at every level
2. **ASCII Diagrams**: Visual representation aids understanding
3. **Consistent Format**: Predictable documentation structure
4. **Real Examples**: Concrete examples over abstract descriptions

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Feature Gaps**: Documentation revealed missing critical features
2. **Test Alignment**: Some tests expect features that don't exist
3. **API Consistency**: Some endpoints could be more RESTful

### Best Practices Established
1. Document concurrency model for every shared resource
2. Include performance characteristics for key operations
3. Provide examples for complex APIs
4. Document both success and failure paths
5. Explain the "why" not just the "what"

## Impact on Development Velocity

### Before Documentation
- Unclear component responsibilities
- Ambiguous error handling
- Uncertain concurrency safety
- Missing operational context

### After Documentation
- ✅ Clear architectural boundaries
- ✅ Explicit error handling strategies
- ✅ Documented thread safety guarantees
- ✅ Complete operational understanding
- ✅ Junior engineer friendly codebase

## Conclusion

The documentation phase has successfully transformed Torua from a functional but opaque system into a well-documented, understandable distributed storage platform. Every function, type, and package now has comprehensive documentation that explains not just what the code does, but why it does it and how it fits into the larger system.

The documentation serves multiple purposes:
1. **Educational**: Teaches system design and distributed systems concepts
2. **Operational**: Guides deployment and monitoring
3. **Developmental**: Accelerates feature development
4. **Quality**: Reveals gaps and inconsistencies

With this foundation, the codebase is now ready for:
- New team members to quickly understand the system
- Feature additions with clear integration points
- Production deployment with operational confidence
- Community contributions with clear guidelines

The investment in documentation has already paid dividends by revealing critical missing features (health monitoring) and will continue to provide value as the system evolves.

## Next Phase: Health Monitoring Implementation

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Start Health Monitor Component**
   - Create `internal/coordinator/health_monitor.go`
   - Implement periodic health check goroutine
   - Add configurable check intervals (default: 5s)
   - Track consecutive failures before marking unhealthy

2. **Update Node Status Tracking**
   - Extend `cluster.NodeInfo` with status field
   - Add LastHealthCheck timestamp
   - Implement status transitions (healthy → unhealthy → unknown)
   - Store failure counts per node

3. **Implement Health Check Endpoint**
   - Add GET `/nodes/{id}/health` to coordinator
   - Return detailed health status with metrics
   - Include last check time and failure history

4. **Add Automatic Shard Redistribution**
   - Detect unhealthy nodes in health monitor
   - Trigger shard reassignment for failed nodes
   - Ensure data availability during redistribution
   - Log all redistribution events

### Success Criteria for Next Phase
- [ ] All 18 cluster-management.feature scenarios passing
- [ ] Health checks running every 5 seconds
- [ ] Nodes marked unhealthy after 3 consecutive failures
- [ ] Automatic shard redistribution within 30 seconds of node failure
- [ ] No data loss during node failures
- [ ] Health status visible in `/nodes` endpoint response

### Estimated Time: 4-6 hours
