### 4. Architecture Documentation Structure
- **README.md**: High-level overview, quick start, use cases
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Deep dive into system design
  - System Overview
  - Coordinator Design
  - Node/Shard Design
  - Communication Protocol
  - Data Distribution
  - Query Execution
  - Fault Tolerance
  - Scaling Strategy

## Key Design Principles to Document
1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first, then implementation
2. **Behavior-Driven Development**: Consider for acceptance tests
3. **Simplicity**: Minimal, clean implementation inspired by Elasticsearch
4. **Distributed by Design**: Horizontal scaling through sharding
5. **Graph-Native**: Kuzu as the embedded graph engine
6. **Fault Tolerant**: Handle node failures gracefully
7. **Observable**: Health checks, monitoring, logging
8. **100% Test Coverage**: Every line of code must be tested

## Next Steps
1. ~~Update README.md with comprehensive overview~~ ✅
2. ~~Create ARCHITECTURE.md with detailed system design~~ ✅
3. ~~Document the coordinator's role in orchestration~~ ✅
4. ~~Document node/shard architecture and Kuzu integration~~ ✅
5. ~~Create Mermaid diagrams for visual representation~~ ✅
6. ~~Write comprehensive test suite with 100% coverage~~ ✅ (97% achieved)
7. ~~Implement TDD/BDD practices going forward~~ ✅
8. ~~Document testing strategy and patterns~~ ✅
9. ~~Implement simple key-value storage in nodes~~ ✅
10. ~~Add distributed routing through coordinator~~ ✅
11. ~~Create BDD test suite with Behave~~ ✅ (framework complete, environment needs fix)
12. Fix BDD test environment (AttributeError in node registration check)
13. Integrate Kuzu graph database (next major step)
14. Implement replication for fault tolerance
15. Add monitoring and metrics endpoints
16. Implement cluster rebalancing

## Questions to Address in Documentation
- How will graph data be partitioned across shards?
- What's the replication factor and consistency model?
- How will distributed graph queries be executed?
- What's the strategy for node failure and recovery?
- How will the system handle hot spots and rebalancing?
- What's the approach for distributed transactions?

## 🎯 NEXT ACTION: Implement Remaining Cluster Management Features

### What's Complete
- ✅ **Health monitoring fully implemented and tested**
- ✅ Node failure detection working (3 failures × 2s = 6s)
- ✅ Process suspension in tests solved with psutil
- ✅ "Node health monitoring" BDD scenario passing

### Why This Is Next
- **17 remaining cluster-management scenarios** need implementation
- **Foundation is ready** with health monitoring complete
- **Tests are waiting** for features like rebalancing, recovery

### Remaining Features Needed
1. **Node recovery detection** - Mark nodes healthy when they recover
2. **Automatic shard rebalancing** - Even distribution when nodes join/leave
3. **Manual shard assignment** - Admin control over shard placement
4. **Graceful node shutdown** - Planned maintenance support
5. **Split-brain prevention** - Quorum-based decisions
6. **Node capacity tracking** - Consider resources in assignments

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All 18 cluster-management scenarios passing
- [ ] Proper node lifecycle management
- [ ] Shard rebalancing on topology changes
- [ ] Admin controls for manual intervention

### Then Continue With...

4. ✅ **Health Monitoring (COMPLETED)**
   - ✅ Periodic health checks implemented (configurable interval)
   - ✅ Node status tracking (healthy/unhealthy/unknown)
   - ✅ Health status in /nodes endpoint
   - ✅ Automatic shard redistribution on failure
   - ✅ Configurable check intervals via env var

5. **Fix remaining cluster-management.feature tests (1/18 passing)**
   - ✅ Node health monitoring scenario passes
   - ⚠️ 17 scenarios need additional features
6. Implement proper shard assignment protocol (replace on-demand workaround)
7. Implement replication (factor of 2 or 3)
8. Add proper metrics endpoint (Prometheus format)
9. Implement shard rebalancing
10. Add transaction support
11. Create GraphQL API layer

## Known Issues
- ✅ **FIXED: BDD Test Process Suspension**: Solved with psutil approach
  - Used psutil to find processes by environment variables
  - SIGSTOP works when applied to correct PID
  - Track suspended PIDs for cleanup
  - Node health monitoring test now passing
- **Shard Assignment Protocol**: Nodes don't know their assigned shards
  - Coordinator assigns shards but doesn't notify nodes
  - Workaround: Nodes create shards on-demand when requests arrive
  - Proper fix: Implement shard assignment notification protocol
- **Shard Distribution**: All shards assigned to first node that registers
  - autoAssignShards() runs on each registration, not after all nodes join
  - Need: Proper rebalancing mechanism
- **Node Failure Handling**: System doesn't properly handle node failures
  - No health checking or failure detection
  - No retry logic for failed requests
