## Things I Regret Not Doing

*(None yet - just starting the documentation phase)*

## Patterns to Avoid

- Overcomplicating explanations when simplicity would suffice
- Making assumptions about implementation details not yet decided
- Writing documentation that's too abstract without concrete examples

## Lessons for Next Iteration

- Keep documentation grounded in the actual code that exists
- Focus on explaining the "why" behind architectural decisions
- Use concrete examples wherever possible
- Don't speculate on features not yet implemented
