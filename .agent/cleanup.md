# Cleanup Tasks

## Documentation
- [x] Review README.md for clarity and completeness after initial draft
- [x] Ensure all code examples in documentation are tested and working
- [x] Check for consistency in terminology across all documentation

## Code Organization
- [ ] Consider if any helper functions in main.go files should move to internal packages
- [ ] Review error handling patterns for consistency

## Documentation Requirements (CORE PACKAGES COMPLETE)
- [x] **Add package documentation** - Every package needs doc.go file
  - [x] internal/cluster/doc.go - Comprehensive package docs added
  - [x] internal/coordinator/doc.go - Comprehensive package docs added
  - [x] internal/shard/doc.go - Comprehensive package docs added
  - [x] internal/storage/doc.go - Comprehensive package docs added
- [x] **Add comprehensive function documentation** - Core packages complete
  - [x] internal/cluster/types.go - All functions and types documented
  - [x] internal/coordinator/shard_registry.go - All functions and types documented
  - [x] internal/shard/shard.go - All functions and types documented
  - [x] internal/storage/store.go - All interfaces and types documented
  - [ ] cmd/coordinator/main.go - Pending (lower priority)
  - [ ] cmd/node/main.go - Pending (lower priority)
- [x] **Add type documentation** - Core types complete
  - [x] cluster.NodeInfo - Fully documented
  - [x] cluster.RegisterRequest - Fully documented
  - [x] cluster.BroadcastRequest - Fully documented
  - [x] coordinator.ShardAssignment - Fully documented
  - [x] coordinator.ShardRegistry - Fully documented
  - [x] shard.Shard - Fully documented
  - [x] shard.ShardStats - Fully documented
  - [x] storage.Store - Fully documented
  - [x] storage.MemoryStore - Fully documented
- [x] **Document complex algorithms** - Core algorithms documented
  - [x] Consistent hashing in GetShardForKey
  - [x] Round-robin rebalancing in RebalanceShards
  - [x] FNV-1a hashing for key distribution
  - [x] RWMutex concurrency patterns
  - [ ] Health check mechanism (in main.go files)
- [x] **Add file headers** - Core packages have headers via package comments
- [x] **Document relationships** - Core relationships documented
  - [x] Component interactions documented in doc.go files
  - [x] ASCII architecture diagrams added
  - [ ] Sequence diagrams for key flows (nice to have)
- [x] **CRITICAL documentation for machine-generated code - CORE COMPLETE**
  - [x] All core packages have comprehensive documentation
  - [x] Progressive understanding enabled (package → type → function)
  - [x] Created learning document: comprehensive-documentation.md
  - [ ] Main.go files still need documentation (lower priority)

## BDD Test Environment Fix (COMPLETED)
- [x] Fix AttributeError in features/environment.py line ~297
  - Problem: `self.test_context.nodes[node_name].port` accessed before node added to dictionary
  - Solution: Fixed JSON response parsing and field name mismatches
- [x] Verify goreman process management works correctly in test environment
- [x] Add proper error handling for process startup failures
- [x] Ensure test cleanup properly terminates all processes
- [x] Fix all JSON response format mismatches (nodes, addr, NodeID, ShardID)
- [x] Fix API endpoint routing (/store/ -> /data/)
- [x] Fix path-based key handling for keys with slashes
- [x] **Result: 100% BDD tests passing (21/21 scenarios)**

## Critical Issues
- [x] **Health Monitoring**: COMPLETED - Coordinator now implements comprehensive node health checking
  - ✅ Created `internal/coordinator/health_monitor.go` with periodic health checks
  - ✅ Configurable health check interval via `HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL` env var
  - ✅ Nodes marked unhealthy after 3 consecutive failures
  - ✅ Health status visible in `/nodes` endpoint
  - ✅ Automatic shard redistribution triggered on node failure
  - ✅ BDD test "Node health monitoring" now passing
  - Remaining: 17 more cluster-management tests need process management fixes
- [x] **Shard Assignment Communication**: Nodes are not informed about their shard assignments
  - Problem: Nodes hardcoded to have shard 0, but coordinator assigns different shards
  - Impact: All data requests fail with "shard not found" 
  - Temporary Solution: Implemented on-demand shard creation in nodes
  - Code locations: 
    - `cmd/node/main.go:62-66` - Removed hardcoded shard 0
    - `cmd/coordinator/main.go:autoAssignShards()` - Assigns shards but doesn't notify nodes
  - **Permanent fix still needed**: Implement proper shard assignment notification protocol

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Add proper logging levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- [ ] Consider adding metrics/observability endpoints
- [ ] Standardize HTTP response formats across all endpoints

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Hard-coded timeout values could be configurable
- [ ] HTTP client in cluster/types.go is a package-level variable
- [ ] Missing proper context propagation in some areas
- [x] Made log.Fatal mockable for testing

## Testing
- [x] Need unit tests for cluster package - 100% coverage achieved
- [x] Need integration tests for coordinator-node communication - completed
- [x] Need load testing for broadcast mechanism - concurrent tests added
- [x] Achieved 97% overall test coverage
- [x] Implemented TDD practices
- [x] Added test targets to Makefile
- [x] Fix BDD test environment to properly verify node registration - COMPLETED
- [x] Complete end-to-end BDD test validation - 100% passing for distributed-storage.feature
- [x] Implement health monitoring - "Node health monitoring" scenario passing (1/18)
- [ ] Fix remaining cluster-management.feature tests (currently 1/18 passing)
  - Health monitoring implemented and working
  - Remaining tests need various cluster management features
- [ ] Add retry logic for flaky network operations in tests

## Deployment
- [ ] Verify Procfile works with common process managers
- [ ] Document deployment strategies for production

## Completed During Testing Phase
- Created comprehensive test suite with 97% coverage
- Established TDD workflow and practices
- Added mockable dependencies for testability
- Implemented concurrent operation testing
- Added coverage reporting to Makefile
- Documented testing strategy in README
