# Cleanup Tasks

## Documentation
- [x] Review README.md for clarity and completeness after initial draft
- [x] Ensure all code examples in documentation are tested and working
- [x] Check for consistency in terminology across all documentation

## Code Organization
- [ ] Consider if any helper functions in main.go files should move to internal packages
- [ ] Review error handling patterns for consistency

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Add proper logging levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- [ ] Consider adding metrics/observability endpoints
- [ ] Standardize HTTP response formats across all endpoints

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Hard-coded timeout values could be configurable
- [ ] HTTP client in cluster/types.go is a package-level variable
- [ ] Missing proper context propagation in some areas
- [x] Made log.Fatal mockable for testing

## Testing
- [x] Need unit tests for cluster package - 100% coverage achieved
- [x] Need integration tests for coordinator-node communication - completed
- [x] Need load testing for broadcast mechanism - concurrent tests added
- [x] Achieved 97% overall test coverage
- [x] Implemented TDD practices
- [x] Added test targets to Makefile

## Deployment
- [ ] Verify Procfile works with common process managers
- [ ] Document deployment strategies for production

## Completed During Testing Phase
- Created comprehensive test suite with 97% coverage
- Established TDD workflow and practices
- Added mockable dependencies for testability
- Implemented concurrent operation testing
- Added coverage reporting to Makefile
- Documented testing strategy in README
