# Torua Project Status

## Executive Summary

Torua is a distributed storage system inspired by Elasticsearch, designed to provide scalable graph database capabilities using embedded Kuzu instances. The project has achieved a working proof-of-concept with comprehensive BDD test coverage, but several critical architectural issues need addressing before production readiness.

**Current State**: Working distributed key-value storage with coordinator-based routing and sharding.

**Test Coverage**: 
- Unit tests: 97% coverage
- BDD tests: 100% passing (21/21 scenarios for distributed storage)

## What's Working

### Core Functionality ✅
- **Distributed Key-Value Storage**: Full CRUD operations (PUT, GET, DELETE)
- **Coordinator-Based Routing**: Requests automatically routed to correct shard/node
- **Sharding**: Consistent hashing distributes keys across 4 shards
- **Node Registration**: Nodes self-register with coordinator on startup
- **Health Endpoints**: Basic health checking for coordinator and nodes
- **Concurrent Operations**: Handles 100+ concurrent clients
- **Large Values**: Successfully stores and retrieves values >1MB
- **Path-Based Keys**: Supports keys with slashes (e.g., "path/to/resource")
- **Unicode Support**: Handles Unicode keys and values
- **Performance**: Sub-50ms response times for basic operations

### Testing Infrastructure ✅
- **BDD Framework**: Behave-based end-to-end testing fully operational
- **Process Management**: Goreman orchestrates multi-node clusters for testing
- **Automated Test Environment**: Dynamic port allocation and cleanup
- **Comprehensive Scenarios**: 21 test scenarios covering all major use cases

## Critical Issues Discovered

### 1. No Shard Assignment Protocol 🔴
**Problem**: Nodes don't know which shards they're responsible for.
- Coordinator tracks shard assignments internally
- Nodes have no way to receive these assignments
- Currently using on-demand shard creation as a workaround

**Impact**: 
- Nodes create shards dynamically when requests arrive
- No way to pre-load data or optimize shard placement
- Inefficient resource utilization

**Solution Required**:
- Implement shard assignment notification protocol
- Add `/shards/assign` endpoint for nodes to receive assignments
- Include shard assignments in registration response

### 2. Shard Distribution Race Condition 🔴
**Problem**: First node to register gets ALL shards.
- `autoAssignShards()` runs on each node registration
- Assigns all unassigned shards immediately
- Later nodes get nothing

**Impact**:
- Completely unbalanced load distribution
- Single point of failure for all data
- Defeats purpose of distributed system

**Solution Required**:
- Implement minimum node threshold before assignment
- Add rebalancing when new nodes join
- Consider delayed assignment strategy

### 3. No Replication 🔴
**Problem**: Each shard exists on only one node.
- Data loss if node fails
- No redundancy or fault tolerance
- No read scaling for hot shards

**Impact**:
- Complete data loss on node failure
- System not production-ready
- No high availability

**Solution Required**:
- Implement replication factor (2 or 3)
- Add primary/replica shard concept
- Implement replica synchronization protocol

### 4. No Failure Detection 🟡
**Problem**: Coordinator doesn't detect when nodes fail.
- No heartbeat mechanism
- No timeout on node connections
- Failed nodes remain in registry

**Impact**:
- Requests routed to dead nodes
- No automatic failover
- Manual intervention required

**Solution Required**:
- Implement heartbeat/ping protocol
- Add node state tracking (healthy/unhealthy/dead)
- Automatic removal of dead nodes
- Trigger rebalancing on node failure

### 5. No Retry Logic 🟡
**Problem**: Failed requests aren't retried.
- Single attempt for all operations
- No exponential backoff
- No circuit breaking

**Impact**:
- Transient failures cause data loss
- Poor user experience
- Reduced reliability

**Solution Required**:
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Implement circuit breakers
- Add request timeout handling

### 6. No Load Balancing 🟡
**Problem**: All requests for a shard go to same node.
- No distribution across replicas
- No consideration of node load
- No smart routing

**Impact**:
- Hot spots can't be mitigated
- Uneven resource utilization
- Poor performance under load

**Solution Required**:
- Round-robin across replicas
- Load-aware routing
- Implement shard request caching

- [ ] **Document all types, interfaces, and packages**
  - Purpose, usage patterns, and invariants
  - Thread safety guarantees
  - Performance characteristics
- [ ] **Add progressive documentation layers**
  - High-level overviews → detailed mechanisms → implementation specifics
  - Humans must understand system composition without reading all code
- [ ] **Document component relationships and interactions**
  - How components depend on each other
  - State transitions and lifecycles
  - Data flow through the system

## Conclusion

Torua has achieved a solid foundation with working distributed storage and comprehensive testing. The critical issues discovered during BDD testing have been clearly identified and documented. With the on-demand shard creation workaround, the system is functional for development and testing, but requires the outlined improvements before production deployment.

The path forward is clear:
1. Fix critical architectural issues (shard assignment, rebalancing, replication)
2. Add reliability features (failure detection, retry logic)
3. Integrate Kuzu for graph capabilities
4. Add production features (monitoring, security, operations)

Estimated timeline to production-ready: 6-8 weeks with focused development.
